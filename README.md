# Errgo Code Assessment

Hi! This is my solution for the Errgo code assessment. I enjoyed working on it! It was fun, different from typical coding assessments.

## Core Tasks

The project is split into two parts: a **React + Vite frontend** and a **Node.js + Express backend**.
I completed all **8 TODOs in the Frontend folder**, including the form to create projects, viewing project details, setting up navigation, and making sure the UI looks clean and responsive. On the backend, I completed the **2 TODOs** for handling project creation and retrieval using API routes. I also completed the bonus todos that were scattered here and there.

## Bonus Feature â€“ Chat

I also finished the bonus task - chat space. It uses WebSockets (`ws`) so users can chat in real time. The chat keeps the message history in memory, so new users can see past messages when they join. I used **Zod** to check the data on the backend and make sure everything is valid. The chat page has a simple, modern design, and a jellyfish <3

## How to Run

To try it out:

* Start the **backend**

```bash
cd Backend  
npm install  
npm run dev  
```

* Then start the **frontend**

```bash
cd Frontend  
npm install  
npm run dev  
```

Thank you!!
